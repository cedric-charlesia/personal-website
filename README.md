# Personal website
Minimalist but yet clean and modern personal website.

As a less is more fan, I wanted something simple and straight to the point, so I built this projet using only plain HTML and CSS.

The live website is available here: [https://cedriccharlesia.com/](https://cedriccharlesia.com)

## How to use it

Simply fork the project, fill the metadata and html template with your infos.
