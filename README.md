# Personal website
As a less is more fan, I wanted something straight to the point and minimalist for my personal website.

Minimalist yes, but yet clean and modern. I built it using only plain html and css.

The live website is available here: [https://cedriccharlesia.com/](https://cedriccharlesia.com/)

## How to use it

Simply fork the project, fill the metadata and html template with your infos.
